# anagram-solver
This is a program for anagrams in Python. This program requests 2 words as inputs from the user and outputs the minimum number of letters
that would need to be added collectively in order to make them anagrams. For example, if the user provides the words "lemon" and "melon", the output 
should be "0" because these two words are already anagrams and no letters need to be added. As a second example, if the user provides the 
words "cat" and "dog", the output would be "6" because there are no common letters between the two words and therefore the letters from each word
will need to be added to the other word to become anagrams.
